# Optimized-site pixel audit, 2026-11-12

**The all-site pixel-equality gate fails.** Hacker News passes; five sites have
rendering differences, and Reddit remains unverified. This is a correctness
audit of the latest completed production bundle available when testing began,
not a new instruction or scrolling benchmark. No rendering implementation,
reference image, tolerance or historical performance result was changed.

| Catalog site | Current result | Differing RGBA pixels | Workload |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Hacker News homepage | Exact in two fresh pairs | **0 / 3,145,728**, every capture | Original six-response instruction archive; 1024×768 CSS pixels, native scale 2, author scripts enabled |
| Lobsters | Fails; initial native launch also crashed | **17,969 / 786,432**, both subsequent native captures | Registered 33-response frozen guest page, full-uBO filtering; scale 1 |
| Old Reddit /r/programming/ | **Unverified** | — | Historical account-bearing fixture is absent; current unauthenticated request returns HTTP 403 |
| CNN homepage | Fails; source/replay gate also fails | **176,037 / 786,432**, both native captures | Registered 85-response frozen guest page, full-uBO filtering; scale 1 |
| Wikipedia portal | Fails in both fresh pairs | **445 / 786,432** | Newly acquired 15-response archive; JavaScript disabled in both engines; scale 1 |
| vlang.io | Fails in both fresh pairs | **309,884 / 786,432** | Newly acquired 42-response archive; JavaScript disabled in both engines; scale 1 |
| GitHub /vlang/v | Fails in both fresh pairs | **38,784 / 786,432** | Retained script-free hydrated DOM and 62 cached resources, sealed original-origin replay; normal scripting policy; scale 1 |

Each listed difference is against a fresh Brave capture of the same sealed
bytes, viewport and script policy. Wikipedia, vlang.io and GitHub reproduce
their respective engine images exactly across both pairs. The two completed
Lobsters images are also identical. CNN's native images differ from each other
at **1,558 pixels**, despite equal cross-browser differing-pixel counts. Its
reference is stable across two fresh Brave processes, so native image stability
also remains open. Every counted comparison uses the full RGBA viewport without
masks or a nonzero tolerance.

## Executable identity and conditions

- Vox executable SHA-256:
  `c4252882672bfdcdf670312d0d836f5fd946805bc393d5ba4bdc0499addc2330`.
- Completed build receipt: `20261112-080916-95bea68e`, source head
  `ec111fb6f6c40bbca1b94071b594233093852a2f`, dirty-input receipt retained.
  The managed build used the C backend, literal V `-prod`, and one C unit.
- Brave: **157.1.99.56**, executable SHA-256
  `a81c3ddf3dd2c5a0e8b0c3d816cac27778d4969df47ae6d5b95fc55b2c60e247`;
  framework SHA-256
  `f8d05a2d5a6324420a9de621d38272937f2c9ae27b8650c011f8c4d8d9422f22`.
- Every browser observation launches a fresh process with a fresh private
  profile/cache. Replay never forwards unknown requests to the live network.
  Replay trust and proxy settings apply only to the test processes. OS caches
  are retained. Vox captures the document viewport, excluding browser chrome;
  screenshot launches use the test display placement policy.
- HN retains two seconds of settling; the full-uBO site checks retain five.
  The original Wikipedia/GitHub capture drivers supply the other capture
  boundaries. The script-disabled vlang.io check does not freeze or replay an
  initialized video frame and makes no live JavaScript-parity claim.
- Browser processes run through memory guards. Focused capture jobs use 3 GiB;
  the existing HN/GitHub comparison-driver invocations use the default 12 GiB.
  HN uses the same private PID registry for its LaunchServices launches and
  memory-guard adoption; the adoption error is null.
- Bundle reader leases protect the grouped replay and native-repeat checks.
  The original drivers also pin their inputs. A final verification of all
  **1,040 HN input paths**, covering both browser bundles, native dependencies,
  fixtures and tools, finds **zero changed identities** across the audit.
  Newly sealed archive bodies are hash-validated too.

Source commits made concurrently after the pinned build are outside this result.
The latest completed bundle was reused; no duplicate production build was
requested to run these checks. This documentation commit requests the normal
managed rebuild, which does not retroactively validate a newer binary.

## Failure details and limits

**Lobsters:** the first native capture exits **139**, with signal 11 in
`layout__layout_uncached_independent_formatting_context`, reached through inline
and flex layout. Both later captures exit 0 and differ from Brave at the same
17,969 pixels. The successful captures do not erase the crash. Both fresh Brave
images match each other and the immutable archived source exactly.

**CNN:** the two fresh Brave replays agree exactly but differ from the archived
source by **107,289 pixels**, retaining the previously documented source/replay
failure. Native differs from the current agreeing Brave replays by 176,037
pixels. The native-repeat difference above prevents a stability pass. All
completed native and Brave capture exits are 0, and the existing full-uBO
request/cosmetic checks pass. Neither source drift nor filtering agreement
excuses the rendering differences.

**GitHub:** the first legacy cache-only driver run loads an unstyled native page
and fails its historical Vox reference by 304,691 pixels. That attempt is retained
as a harness/cache failure, not the final rendering result. Replaying the retained
raw resources at their original URLs restores styles. Both fresh Brave images
then match the unchanged historical Brave reference exactly; native differs from
the historical Vox reference by **37,997 pixels** and from Brave by 38,784.
Native URL/readiness/viewport checks and all **33 directory-row identities** pass.
The 33-row audit alone does not prove every resource or interaction is supported.

**Wikipedia and vlang.io:** their historical Build fixtures are absent, so the
new archives establish current cross-browser differences, not preservation or
regression relative to the historical workloads. Wikipedia's earlier seven-pixel
gap and vlang.io's earlier 112,005-pixel gap cannot be compared numerically with
these new workloads as a before/after result. Most current vlang.io differences
are small: 3,244 pixels exceed three channel levels; maximum error is 136.
Wikipedia's maximum error is 171. Both still fail the exact gate.

**Reddit:** the missing `/r/programming/` archive was not replaced by another
subreddit, a login page or the old Linux `/r/worldnews/` evidence. The current
request returns 403 at the requested URL. The historical Reddit homepage claim
also remains unverified; this audit supplies no recovered private fixture.

The English Wikipedia Main Page mentioned in the catalog's separate scrolling
follow-up is a different workload from the portal row tested here. This audit
does not establish live-site parity, whole-document/scrolling parity, interactive
JavaScript correctness, or a performance gain.

## Reproduction and local evidence

The runs use canonical tools:

- [HN comparison driver](../tools/hacker_news_browser_instructions.py), with
  `--home-archive Tests/Browser/Brave/hn-home-instructions --instruction-scope launch
  --repeat 2 --scale 2 --settle-seconds 2`.
- [Forum/news driver](../tools/forum_news_pixels.py), with
  `--sites lobsters,cnn --cache-policy cold`, full uBO **1.75.0**, the repository
  filter snapshots, and a checker built from `tools/adblock_check.v` using
  `-b c -enable-globals -memory-limit 10G`.
- [Archive tool](../tools/page_archive.py) to acquire the current Wikipedia and
  vlang.io bytes; the retained GitHub cache is imported without live fetching.
  [Wikipedia capture primitives](../tools/wikipedia_browser_instructions.py)
  and [GitHub row validation](../tools/github_browser_instructions.py) execute
  the paired original-origin replays. The local command scripts record the
  explicit script policies and reader leases.
- The existing verified `Build/pixel-tools/pixel_diff`; known exact and
  one-pixel controls pass again. The local evidence records its hash.

Raw PNGs, diffs, audits, command scripts, process exits, guard receipts, fixture
manifests/bodies, before/after identity pins and the completed-build receipt are
retained locally under
`docs/performance/optimized-pixels-20261112/`. They are deliberately not committed.
The corresponding per-job Build directories, locks and guard files were removed
after collecting the report. Embedded absolute paths in raw receipts retain the
original Build locations; `relocation.json` maps them to their local locations.

Failed attempts remain in that evidence: the initial HN invocation rejected
`--repeat 1`; checker builds first lacked `-enable-globals`, then selected the
unsupported FastC generic path before the successful explicit C build; the
first repeat script serialized the proxy port as a number instead of a string
and exited before browser startup. Corrected repeats use fresh output paths.
These setup failures receive no rendering credit. The replay controller exits
0 after recording the comparisons; that is successful evidence collection,
**not** an all-site parity pass.
