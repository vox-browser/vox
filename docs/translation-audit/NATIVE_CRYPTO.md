# Native Crypto binding translation

Reference: Ladybird `963d46a829f3e1b79f44dba9d02afb70654300fa`.

The native QuotaExceededError binding translates the source constructor and
nullable quota/requested attributes. It wraps the actual WebIDL record through
the shared DOMException identity map, retains its subclass prototype, and
preserves original engine exceptions during dictionary property reads and
primitive conversion. Numeric conversion uses the real engine ToNumber
operation, including BigInt rejection, before the source range checks.

Focused native tests cover defaults, subclass construction, source field order,
range/nonfinite errors, original thrown-value identity, and repeated wrapping
of the same native exception record. Wrapper records remain rooted until the
owning Runtime closes. This native JavaScriptCore adapter does not establish
LibJS builtin/realm parity or native structured-clone wrapper reconstruction.
